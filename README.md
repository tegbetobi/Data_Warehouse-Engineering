## 🧾 Executive Summary

- ✅ **Pipeline scope:** Built a complete **ETL pipeline** from raw CSVs to star schema warehouse to analytical marts  
- ✅ **Data modeling:** Designed a **star schema** with fact tables, dimensions, and bridge tables for many-to-many relationships  
- ✅ **ETL development:** Implemented **extract, transform, load** processes with idempotent operations and data quality checks  
- ✅ **Mart architecture:** Created **specialized data marts** (flat, skills) with additive measures

## 🧩 Problem & Context

Raw job posting data arrives as flat CSV files in Google Cloud Storage—not structured for analytical queries. Analysts need to answer:

- Which skills are most in-demand over time?
- What are hiring trends by company and location?
- How do salary patterns vary by role and skill?

**Challenge:** Data teams need a single source of truth system—a data warehouse—to enable consistent, reliable analysis across the organization. Additionally, specialized data marts are required to optimize resources by pre-aggregating data for specific business use cases, reducing query complexity and improving performance for common analytical patterns.

**Solution:** End-to-end ETL pipeline that extracts CSVs from cloud storage, normalizes them into a star schema warehouse (separating facts from dimensions), and creates specialized data marts optimized for specific use cases (flat queries, skill demand analysis).

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture


![Data Pipeline Architecture](/Resources/images/1_2_Project2_Data_Pipeline.png)

The pipeline transforms job posting CSVs from Google Cloud Storage into a normalized star schema data warehouse, then builds specialized analytical data marts. BI tools (Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python) consume from both the warehouse and marts.

### Data Warehouse

The data warehouse implements a star schema with `company_dim`, `skills_dim`, `job_postings_fact`, and `skills_job_dim` tables.

![Data Warehouse Schema](/Resources/images/1_2_Data_Warehouse.png)

- **SQL Files:**
  - [`01_create_tables_dw.sql`](./01_create_tables_dw.sql) – Defines star schema with 4 core tables
  - [`02_load_schema_dw.sql`](./02_load_schema_dw.sql) – Extracts CSVs from GCS and loads into warehouse tables
- **Purpose:** Star schema serving as single source of truth for analytical queries
- **Grain:** One row per job posting in the fact table (`job_postings_fact`)

### Flat Mart

Denormalized table with all dimensions for ad-hoc queries.

- **SQL File:** [`03_create_flat_mart.sql`](./03_create_flat_mart.sql) – Builds denormalized table with all dimensions joined
- **Purpose:** Denormalized table for quick ad-hoc queries
- **Grain:** One row per job posting with all dimensions joined

### Skills Mart

Time-series skill demand analysis with additive measures.

- **SQL File:** [`04_create_skills_mart.sql`](./04_create_skills_mart.sql) – Builds time-series skill demand mart
- **Purpose:** Time-series analysis of skill demand over time with additive measures
- **Grain:** `skill_id + month_start_date + job_title_short`
- **Key Features:** All measures are additive (counts/sums) for safe re-aggregation

## 💻 Data Engineering Skills Demonstrated

### ETL Pipeline Development

- **Extract:** Direct CSV loading from Google Cloud Storage using DuckDB's `httpfs` extension  
- **Transform:** Data normalization, type conversion (`CAST`, `DATE_TRUNC`), and quality filtering  
- **Load:** Idempotent table creation with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` patterns  
- **Orchestration:** Master SQL script (`build_dw_marts.sql`) for automated pipeline execution  

### Dimensional Modeling

- **Star Schema Design:** Fact table (`job_postings_fact`) with dimension tables (`company_dim`, `skills_dim`)  
- **Bridge Tables:** Many-to-many relationship handling (`skills_job_dim`, `bridge_company_location`, `bridge_job_title`)  
- **Grain Definition:** Proper fact table granularity (skill+month, company+title+location+month)  
- **Additive Measures:** Counts and sums that can be safely re-aggregated at any level  


### SQL Advanced Techniques

- **DDL Operations:** `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE SCHEMA` for schema management  
- **DML Operations:** `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` with explicit column mapping from CSV sources   
- **CTEs:** Common Table Expressions for complex transformations and boolean flag conversions  
- **Date Functions:** `DATE_TRUNC('month')`, `EXTRACT(quarter)` for temporal dimension creation  
- **Boolean Logic:** `CASE WHEN` conversions for aggregating flags (remote, health insurance, no degree)  

### Data Quality & Production Practices

- **Idempotency:** All scripts safely rerunnable without side effects  
- **Data Validation:** Verification queries at each pipeline step to ensure data integrity  
- **Type Safety:** Proper data type definitions (`VARCHAR`, `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `TIMESTAMP`)  
- **Schema Organization:** Separate schemas (`flat_mart`, `skills_mart`) for logical separation  
- **Error Handling:** Structured script execution with clear error messages and progress reporting
